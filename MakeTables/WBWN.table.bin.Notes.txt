I measured the 10 recommended linux compression utilities from this web site:
https://www.maketecheasier.com/best-compression-tools-linux/

The pixz linux compression utility does the second best compression rate, after 7zip.
Actually, it did slightly better with WBWN.table.compressed.bin
But it also boasts "makes randomly accessing the original data straightforward"!
Hopefully that means I won't ever have to decompress the whole original file.
The extension is .xz

pixz derives from xz, but seems to run faster (parallel implementation)
and have the random access property.
More info and source code available here:

plzip has a competitive compression ratio.

zstd(Zstandard) comes with multiple language bindings.
